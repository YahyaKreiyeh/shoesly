Project setup instructions.
1- open pubspec.yaml
2- run flutter pub get
3- run the app

Assumptions you made during developmen
1- no filter functionality needed
2- no reviews submession
3- the header in each page is grouped under scrollable in figma so i put it in the body else i could have set it as fixed appbar at the top of the page

Challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
1- i've had hard time trying to configure the function for average rating i wanted it to work properly so i have searched a lot on goolge and stackoverflow on how to implement it but nothing helped,
finally i was able to reach out to a colleage who is a senior backend developer and helped me sort out how i can configure the function to do what it suppose to in supabase

Any additional features or improvements you added.
1- i've made sure the design matches the ui 100%
2- i've added custom functions and utils that i have gathered throughout my experince over the years
